# Register a user

Work inside `src/App.jsx`.

1. Create a form with two inputs, one for a username and one for a password, and a submit button.
2. When the submit button is pressed, send a request to the registration route of your [auth-hashing](https://github.com/boolean-uk/auth-hashing) API using the input values. Make sure you structure the body in the way your API is expecting.
3. Save the response in state and render it on the page.
